  It sounded like it came from the balcony.

  Was it a bird trying to come in? Or a twig from a long tree?

  Despite my many protests the night before, I was comfortable in bed and didn't want to leave.

  The blankets were warm and fuzzy against my skin, and it felt like clouds between my heavy limbs.

  She wouldn't want me getting out of bed during these later hours.

  Especially when it gets chillier.

  Or maybe...

  I couldn't help myself as my eyes closed once again. The steady rise and fall of my chest luring me back into sleep.

  This wasn't going... to work.

  With the last bit of energy I had, my legs slowly kicked over the side of the bed.

  I fumbled with lighting a candle, but eventually gave up and headed towards the balcony.

  If the balcony was so insistent on keeping me awake, I hope it brings me something entertaining.

  Like a balcony size ball, just for me.

  But not a bird, or a twig.

  In front of the balcony glass, I grabbed the curtains and slowly pulled them aside.

  Nothing was there.

  It was hard to see already in the darkness, but not a single scratching sound or sight to behold.

  I tried to hide my resentment towards the situation, but it inevitably showed on my face most likely.

  Royally irritated, I flung the curtains back open ready to roll my sleeves up and suffocate what poor thing was out there making that sound.

  Instead a bird, animal, or even a stray twig brushing against the glass...

  A tall man was there, nursing his right shoulder with his back turned towards me.

  I couldn't see much, but the man seemed to be hunched forward slightly panting.

  A greeting slips past me and disappears at the tip of my tongue.

  What would I say to this stranger? 

  My breath hitched in my throat as the strangers' eyes met mine.

  My blood ran cold.

  His eyes were cold and clear on the surface. The crimson color shone strangely while the rest of him was concealed in the darkness.

  Those red eyes... they were as red as blood. 

  My heart skipped a beat, threatening to leap out of my chest.

  What... who was I staring at?

  Unable to control the fear seizing my legs, I stepped backwards slowly.

  Maybe he couldn't see me through the glass, maybe this was just a coincidence. 

  Maybe this was a dream.

  But the stranger's eyes shone in recognition, and he gently rapped against the balcony glass.
