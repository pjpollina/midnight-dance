  The clock read 11 PM, nearly midnight when the fireworks would go out.

  He always stayed up to watch the fireworks light up the sky.

  Since he was already awake, he might as well watch them while keeping an eye on the stranger.

  Speaking of him...

  My fingers brushed down his bare chest, the sheets beneath him stained with blood from the procedure.

  everett "What mess did you wrap yourself in, to end up in this sorry state?"

  balth "Nothing I couldn't handle, of course."

  """
  I stifle a gasp as the mans eyes slowly open, landing on mine.

  He shouldn't have awakened so early... not with his injuries.

  Who exactly was he?
  """

  everett "Are you okay? I tried to patch you up the best I could."

  "The man blinked and checked his shoulder confused. He was surprisingly mobile for someone with bullet wounds."

  balth "I'm doing better thanks to you."

  everett "But you're so pale..."

  """
  I didn't want to sound rude, but it was so noticeable.

  Was he sickly like me? 

  It couldn't be. This man somehow found his way onto my balcony which isn't a close climb from the ground.
  """

  balth "That's my natural complexion, nothing for you to worry about."

  everett "Be careful!"

  "The man sat up easily, showing no signs of pain or discomfort."

  everett "...or you'll hurt yourself again."

  balth "Impossible, thank you for taking care of me."
  balth "I'll remember this act."

  "He tossed the covers off of him and stood up. I winced at the sight, but he was already heading towards the balcony glass."

  everett "Wai-wait!"

  "I scramble on the other side of the bed getting to my feet."

  everett "Where are you going? You're still hurt!"

  "The man's speed didn't slow down."

  balth "I will be fine, trust me. This is nothing."

  everett "Couldn't you stay a little longer? Just to make sure your injuries don't reopen{em}"

  balth "That won't be necessary."

  everett "No... please don't go{em}"

  My chest grew tight, straining to get a proper breath in.

  No... not now, not now!

  My head whips around in a dizzy confusion, patting around me trying to find something.

  # TODO - BLUR EFFECT

  """
  What was I trying to find? Think, Everett, think!

  The lack of air made my vision go blurry.

  I gasp for air, feeling the air sucked out of my body doubling me over.

  I couldn't focus on anything, only feeling my body grow heavier and the carpet sticking to my sweaty forehead.

  Stop looking pathetic Everett! Keep asking him to stay{em}

  Something was shoved into my hands, and I pry open one eye to see my inhaler magically there.

  With my hands shaking, I immediately lean my head back and inhale the medication. 

  Slowly, but surely, the tightness in my chest went away. The blurriness dissipating as well.

  When my vision cleared, the man was kneeling right in front of me with an unreadable expression.

  everett "Yea-yeah..."

  I didn't notice it until now, but the stranger's hand was on my back.

  A shiver ran through me.

  balth "Why do you want me to stay?"

  I froze, feeling the heat returning to my face as I bowed my head in shame.

  What was I doing? Forcing a stranger to stay in your room is kidnapping right?

  everett "I..."
  everett "I just wanted to hear about the outside."
  everett "I haven't left this room since I was a little kid. My parents keep me here to prevent any over-exertion."
  everett "As you saw, I'm not the healthiest guy out there..."

  "I tried to chuckle, but it almost brought on a coughing fit which made my chest tighten slightly."

  everett "I'm sorry, I shouldn't force you to stay."
  everett "I just really want to hear about the sights and smells and the sort."
  everett "You know?"

  balth "I think I understand now."

  "My eyes widen as the stranger gets up, walking towards the bed to lean against it."

  balth "If only to repay your generosity, I'll stay and share with you what you wish to hear."

  "My heart skips a beat, a smile growing as I eagerly stood."

  everett "Really? You'll stay?"

  balth "Just for a little while, you wish to hear from the outside, right?"
  balth "Fortunately for you, I carry many stories..."
