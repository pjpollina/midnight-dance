  He suddenly grabbed my hand firmly as we began the slow waltz.

  At first we just swayed, his hand snaking around my waist pulling me close. 

  Then as I figured the rhythm out, he began spinning me around carefully.

  We spun in circles, shuffling our feet to his soft hum.

  My feet were clumsy and my legs felt like they would buckle from embarrassment.

  But all he did was pull me towards his chest; our bodies close the space.

  Before long, we were dancing as if we've been dancing all our lives.

  I couldn't hide the big smile on my face, growing too excited that I nearly stumbled into his chest.

  He chuckled beneath his breath as we danced.

  His humming never quickened, knowing that I'd make a major fool of myself if he did.

  This was better than I could ever imagine.

  I knew that I've always wanted to dance with someone I admire.

  But who knew it would be as good as this?

  It was just as I imagined. Our feet gracefully sliding across the carpeted floors.

  The light from the candles had never felt more warm and fuzzy.

  When we were dancing, it felt like hours passed. With only the feeling of his hand in mine resonating.

  I urged him towards the balcony, leaning against the railing.

  Moments later, I regretted coming out without a blanket. But the stranger tossed one over my shoulders and leaned against the railing next to me.
