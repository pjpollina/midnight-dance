  The fireworks lit the dark sky with warm colors. Sprinkling down to the ground after a grand display of vivid colors.

  Tonight, the fireworks felt brighter than ever.

  As I watched the fireworks go by, I felt the stranger's gaze on me and turned red.

  What was he looking at? What was more pretty than the fireworks in front of him?

  I held my hand out for him. His hand once again enveloped mine, larger and surprisingly cold for how warm his personality was.

  Nothing could've made this night better.

  I hadn't noticed him closing the distance between us, his hands grazing the sides of my face.

  Before I had time to retaliate, he lowered one arm around my waist and pulled me closer to him.

  His lips didn't meet mine, but his warm breath against my skin brought tingles across me.
