  Prince Everett worked for hours on the stranger. 

  Undressing him was rather a hassle, as he tried not to get humiliated by his own physique staring at the stranger's muscular one.

  He didn't have any bottles of whisky to ease the man's pain in case he woke up, so he had to work fast. A long, arduous procedure began with carefully removing the bullets from both gun wounds. They were both made of silver and very expensive.

  That process took up most of his time, with a few candles lit. After that was completed, he cleaned the wound with some water. Some poultice was put on top and he went to work sewing the holes shut. 

  Then clean white bandages would carefully be wrapped across his stomach and shoulder.

  It was the best he could do at this time, though this stranger would probably have to go to the hospital soon. Everett wouldn't be surprised if the man became feverish afterward.
