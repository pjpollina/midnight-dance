  And just like that, the sickly prince and his knight in tattered clothes shared stories.
  One of the outdoors and what it offers, and the other of his home life.

  They shared laughs, the first in a long time that made the world spin a little slower.

  Time slowed, and the prince was entranced with the stranger's way of talking.
  More candles were lit so he didn't have to stare indarkness while listening.

  He was just so graceful in everything he did. From the way his blonde hair fell over his shoulders,
  moving with every slight emphasis. His thin lips detailing stories ranging from escapades to late night kisses stolen,
  scandals and the sort that would liven anyone's day.

  How his crimson eyes shone bright in some explanations while dimming warmly in others. Prince Everett admired the man,
  not only for his looks but for his adventures.

  He lived his life to the fullest, running risks every day and always having something to look forward to.

  Oh how he wished he could do the same, so dreadfully so.

  "My attention immediately honed onto him, waiting for those details I eagerly wanted."
  balth "...the bore. I wish I would never go to one as long as I live."
  "What?"

  everett "No way..."
  "My stomach churns at the thought of my dream being considered a bore. Was everything I thought of just fantastical?"
  "The man seemed to notice my dampened mood, as he immediately changed the subject to something way worse."

  balth "What prevents you from sneaking out and exploring the town?"
  everett "Me? Sneak out?"

  "It wasn't a new idea."
  "I had a few escape attempts over the years, mostly during my pubescent stage."
  "But every time I tried a guard captured me, or I became so sickly I ran back home in fear."
  "Even now, the thought of escaping once again made a familiar dread wash over me."

  everett "I... can't. This will just have to do, I guess."
  "I mustered the most realistic smile I could, trying to find something else to talk about."
  everett "But it isn't all that bad, I like to imagine that I'm attending the ball with everyone else. Watching them have fun from afar is enough for me..."
  "...nothing but a lie!"

  balth "Oh? You enjoy the balls?"
  balth "I apologize for ruining your vision of it."

  everett "Oh no no it's okay! Maybe it wasn't anything too special anyway. Dancing with someone in a beautiful ballroom, someone who is special to you..."
  "I lost track, smiling distantly until the stranger broke the silence."
  balth "I hope you get the opportunity to dance with someone you admire."
  everett "Yeah... I do as well."

  "The silence between us was comfortable every time we fell into it."
  "I didn't feel the need to talk anymore, just enjoy the man's presence."
  "Though it would only be temporary."

  everett "Why haven't you left yet? It's midnight and you've shared your stories. I can't keep you here."
  balth "To be honest with you... you're too interesting to leave."

  "I felt the world come to a screeching halt, heat blossoming around my cheeks."

  everett "What?"

  balth "All my life I've been surrounded by people who mask themselves and act well-bred."
  balth "No one was true to themselves, or to how they felt about me."
  balth "But you... you nearly died to keep me here. And that was no act."

  "I chuckled, rubbing my arm looking away."

  balth "You not only asked me to stay, but you look sad around me."
  balth "I have never seen someone look so downtrodden in my presence. They usually say I make it all better."
  balth "You show your true self to me... and I think that's worth staying longer for."

  "It warmed me just a little... But not long enough to delude me."

  everett "I don't really know how to dance."
  balth "But I do, I'll lead the way. Just follow my steps."

  "He suddenly grabbed my hand firmly as we began the slow waltz."
  "At first we just swayed, his hand snaking around my waist pulling me close."
  "Then as I figured the rhythm out, he began spinning me around carefully."
  "We spun in circles, shuffling our feet to his soft hum."
  "My feet were clumsy and my legs felt like they would buckle from embarrassment."
  "But all he did was pull me towards his chest; our bodies close the space."
  "Before long, we were dancing as if we've been dancing all our lives."
  "I couldn't hide the big smile on my face, growing too excited that I nearly stumbled into his chest."

  everett "You're a good teacher."
  balth "You're not half bad to teach, I thought you would be way worse."

  "He chuckled beneath his breath as we danced."
  "His humming never quickened, knowing that I'd make a major fool of myself if he did."
  "This was better than I could ever imagine."
  "I knew that I've always wanted to dance with someone I admire."
  "But who knew it would be as good as this?"
  "It was just as I imagined. Our feet gracefully sliding across the carpeted floors."
  "The light from the candles had never felt more warm and fuzzy."
