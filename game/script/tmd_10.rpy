  And just like that, the sickly prince and his knight in tattered clothes shared stories. One of the outdoors and what it offers, and the other of his home life. 

  They shared laughs, the first in a long time that made the world spin a little slower. Time slowed, and the prince was entranced with the stranger's way of talking. More candles were lit so he didn't have to stare indarkness while listening.

  He was just so graceful in everything he did. From the way his blonde hair fell over his shoulders, moving with every slight emphasis. His thin lips detailing stories ranging from escapades to late night kisses stolen, scandals and the sort that would liven anyone's day. How his crimson eyes shone bright in some explanations while dimming warmly in others.

  Prince Everett admired the man, not only for his looks but for his adventures. He lived his life to the fullest, running risks every day and always having something to look forward to.

  Oh how he wished he could do the same, so dreadfully so.
