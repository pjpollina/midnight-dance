  My feet still traced the steps in our slow waltz, memorizing every movement.

  Except he was gone, and even though he promised he would return, he didn't.

  The balcony was now a place of insurmountable sadness rather than joy.

  The people preparing for the ball didn't interest me anymore.

  Just the way he was that night.

  My chest ached, and I grabbed my shirt. Balling it into my fist.

  Before long I would have to return inside. Another day gone by.

  Another day...
