  The man was clearly injured cradling his shoulder the way he was..

  Also who knows how long he'd rap against the glass? I'd lose all my sleep!

  Hesitantly, I approached the balcony glass and pulled it aside.

  The strong chilly breeze hit me like a brick, nearly knocking me back as the stranger stared in a mix of amusement and shock.

  balth "I'm surprised you actually invited me in, just who are you?"
  everett "We will have plenty to talk about once you're out of the cold."
  balth "Plenty to talk about?"

  "The stranger stepped forward out of the harsh elements as I closed the balcony glass behind him."

  everett "Make yourself at home I guess..."

  "There was no response from the stranger, who stood dangerously still with his chin to the ground."

  everett "A name would be nice too."
  everett "...Stranger?"

  """
  The man still didn't reply as I came up behind him, gently touching his shoulder to turn him around.

  He swayed back and forth before crumpling into the ground without notice. My grip on his shoulder tightened as I swung an arm beneath his armpit to make sure he didn't fall.

  Slowly, I lowered him to the ground on his knees. He was too heavy for me to keep on his feet.

  everett "This shoulder injury must be worse than I thought..."

  "Even unconscious, the man concealed his wound from him. But from a glimpse it was soaking through his clothes."

  everett "I guess we'll have to fix this before I get any answers..."

  "I looped both of my arms beneath his armpits and started dragging him towards my bed."

  guarda "Where is that criminal fiend?"
  maid "I hope Your Highness is okay!"
  guardb "He disappeared into the hedges near the Highnesses balcony, he has to be up there!"

  """
  My heart leapt to my throat at the sounds of the scullery maid and some guards faintly outside. 

  How could I hide the man in such a short time?
  """

  everett "Why am I... doing so much... for you?!"

  """
  Because I wanted to hear about the outside, of course.

  Come on! What could I do?

  Think Everett, think...

  Racking my head for a solution, the pillows flung beneath my blankets spawned an idea.

  The pillows! I'll hide him under my pillows and blankets!

  I hastened my grip and dragged the man towards the side of the bed. Half leant against the bed, I pull him on top trying not to lose my breath.

  This was the most exertion I've had in awhile. My arms shook from the effort.

  When half of the man was on the bed, I pushed the rest of him up and immediately flung pillows and blankets on top trying to make it look neat.

  Taking a deep breath, I ran my fingers through my hair and straightened up trying to rub away the hot feeling in my face.

  Look normal, Everett.

  Inhale...
