  "My attention immediately honed onto him, waiting for those details I eagerly wanted."

  balth "...the bore. I wish I would never go to one as long as I live."

  "What?"

  everett "No way..."

  """
  My stomach churns at the thought of my dream being considered a bore. Was everything I thought of just fantastical?

  The man seemed to notice my dampened mood, as he immediately changed the subject to something way worse.

  balth "What prevents you from sneaking out and exploring the town?"

  everett "Me? Sneak out?"

  """
  It wasn't a new idea.

  I had a few escape attempts over the years, mostly during my pubescent stage.

  But every time I tried a guard captured me, or I became so sickly I ran back home in fear.

  Even now, the thought of escaping once again made a familiar dread wash over me.

  everett "I... can't. This will just have to do, I guess."

  "I mustered the most realistic smile I could, trying to find something else to talk about."

  everett "But it isn't all that bad, I like to imagine that I'm attending the ball with everyone else. Watching them have fun from afar is enough for me..."

  "...nothing but a lie!"

  balth "Oh? You enjoy the balls?"
  balth "I apologize for ruining your vision of it."

  everett "Oh no no it's okay! Maybe it wasn't anything too special anyway. Dancing with someone in a beautiful ballroom, someone who is special to you..."

  balth "I hope you get the opportunity to dance with someone you admire."

  everett "Yeah... I do as well."

  """
  The silence between us was comfortable every time we fell into it. I didn't feel the need to talk anymore, just enjoy the man's presence.

  Though it would only be temporary.

  everett "Why haven't you left yet? It's midnight and you've shared your stories. I can't keep you here."

  balth "To be honest with you... you're too interesting to leave."

  "I felt the world come to a screeching halt, heat blossoming around my cheeks."

  everett "What?"

  balth "All my life I've been surrounded by people who mask themselves and act well-bred."

  balth "No one was true to themselves, or to how they felt about me."

  balth "But you... you nearly died to keep me here. And that was no act."

  "I chuckled, rubbing my arm looking away."

  balth "You not only asked me to stay, but you look sad around me."

  balth "I have never seen someone look so downtrodden in my presence. They usually say I make it all better."

  balth "You show your true self to me... and I think that's worth staying longer for."

  "I was stunned into silence."

  "I was interrupted by the man standing on his feet, offering a hand towards me."
