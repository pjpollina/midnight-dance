  "I felt the warm embrace of his jacket around my shoulders, the smell of his cologne tickling my nose."
  "Pulling it closer around me, he leaned against the railing just like before."

  everett "Balthazar...?"

  "I reached towards him and he didn't move away."

  everett "Why are you running away from the guards? Did you..."
  everett "Harm someone?"

  "His eyes flashed with an unrecognizable emotion, but he didn't deny the accusation."

  balth "It's been a long life before I met you, Everett. One that I shouldn't tell you fully."
  everett "Why not?"
  balth "It will entangle you in it, and I wouldn't wish to harm you."

  balth "They talk of me like a scoundrel?"
  everett "...among other names that aren't nice."

  everett "Listen. I want to help you however I can. You rescued me from my prison, at least let me help you get out of yours."
  everett "I'm weak, but I'm not so weak as to steal a night with you and not help you in return."
  balth "Everett..."

  His eyes were wide in shock, as if he had never heard those words.

  Then he chuckled, bursting out into laughter that seemed unfitting for the situation.

  everett "What's so funny?"
  balth "You surprise me, human."

  "Human?"

  balth "If I must trudge down that weary road again, at least I'd like to do it with a companion."
  everett "So you'll tell me?"

  "Balthazar nodded, smiling fondly."

  balth "I'll tell you everything, starting from the very beginning..."
  balth "Of when I became a vampire."
