  "They were quick!"

  maid worry "Your Royal Highness! Is everything alright in there?"
  everett "Everything... is fine, Miss! Nothing is wrong here."
  everett "What is the matter that you have to wake me up so late?"
  maid worry "I'm so sorry Your Royal Highness, but we must come in. There is a minor... disturbance we need to check out."

  "So they're keeping me in the dark about him?"

  everett "If you must, come in."

  The door slowly opened to the scullery maid and two guards behind her. They brandished their swords clear as day as the maid quickly lit all the candles.

  The maid stood by the door with her candle as the guards explored the room. They mainly focused their attention on the balcony glass.

  Fortunately, they didn't think to check the bed.

  maid "Are you sure you're alright, Your Highness? Your cheeks are flush."
  everett "Are they now?"

  "I tried to sound surprised, but instead it comes out as sarcastic and I bite the inside of my cheek. The maid will not receive my irritation tonight."

  everett "Must be from before I retired to bed. It's awfully cold outside."
  maid "...truly."

  "We fell into silence again as the guards finished investigating every crevice. I leaned back slightly onto the bed, just to deter them from checking there."

  everett "I hope everything is alright."
  maid "Oh it is! We were just checking for some... critter. It doesn't seem to be in here so no need to worry."
  everett "Is that so? I'm glad. Thank you everyone for making me feel safe."

  "The mood in the room lightened a little as the scullery maid smiled warmly."

  maid "We will be off now, get some rest."
  everett "Goodnight, miss."
  maid "Goodnight, to you Your Royal Highness."

  With a curtsy from her and a bow from the guards, they left as quickly as they came in.

  As soon as their footsteps went quiet, I let out the breath that I didn't realize I was holding back.

  I turned towards the bed and gently pulled the blankets off to see if the stranger was still there.

  To my irrational surprise, he was.

  Though now that danger wasn't looming, I realized I never got a good look at him.
